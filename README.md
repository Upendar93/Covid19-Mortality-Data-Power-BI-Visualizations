# Covid19-Mortality-Data-Power-BI-Visualizations
# COVID-19 Mortality Analysis Report (United States)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI report analyzing COVID-19 mortality trends in the United States.  
The goal of the analysis is to understand the **impact of COVID-19 deaths across time, age groups, causes of death, and geographic regions**, enabling data-driven insights for healthcare analysis and public policy understanding.

The report is designed as a **multi-page analytical report** (not a dashboard), allowing structured exploration of different dimensions of the data.

## ❓ Business & Analytical Questions
- What is the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the US?
- What percentage of total deaths were attributed to COVID-19?
- How did COVID-19 deaths trend over time?
- Which age groups were most affected?
- How does COVID-19 compare with Pneumonia and Influenza as causes of death?
- Which US states experienced the highest COVID-19 impact?

## 🔄 Data & Methodology
- **Data Source:** CDC – Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using **Power BI Power Query**
- Removed null values and standardized date fields
- Created a **date hierarchy** for time-based analysis
- Built DAX measures for:
  - Total COVID Deaths
  - Total Deaths (All Causes)
  - COVID Share of Total Deaths (%)
  - Peak Monthly COVID Deaths
